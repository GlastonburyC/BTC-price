BTC-price
=========

This is a simple python script that grabs the last price of bitcoin from MtGox every 3 seconds 
(However, it's easily modified to be realtime)


For this to work you will need the requests module in python, an improvement upon urllib2.

git clone git://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git

sudo python setup.py install

And you're good to go!
